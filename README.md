# Personal Project: Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc. Website Redesign

For one of my homework assignments in a high school Web Design course, I decided to attempt to redesign the Roche Bros. Supermarkets website. At the time, Roche Bros. had two different websites: a static site with information about the company and its store locations, and a dynamic site which customers could use to order groceries online. I noticed that the design of the static website looked completely different than that of the dynamic site; therefore, I took it upon myself to redesign their static website so that both designs were consistent. This project is a proof of concept for what that final design could look like.
